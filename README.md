# machine_learning_supervised_models
Repo for the Machine Learning with Supervised Models from CU Boulder - MSDS

In this project, I will experiment with building a Machine Learning model using basic Supervised ML algorithms to predict Heart Attacks based on CDC data from the US available in Kaggle.

All of the information and details about the project can be found on the Jupyter Notebook.
